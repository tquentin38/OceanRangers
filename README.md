# Ocean Rangers

You join the organization Trash Reduction And Sea Protection - TRASP - whose goal is to send teams of volunteers on scientific boats to explore the ocean floor. However, due to a lack of funds and a surge in volunteers for missions, you find yourself on a rather modest boat with a quite damaged exploration robot. With your team, you embark on the challenge of renovating your ship and exploration robot using materials collected from the ocean during your marine exploration missions. Will you be able to reach the depths of the ocean?
